# GLboot

A personal thin abstraction over OpenGL meant to be an experiment in both CG and general software implementation in Rust and a bootstrap to be used in my realtime CG studies.

Since everything here is experimental it's not really meant to be published or used by anyone else, but I'll *try* to keep everything documented and commented, just for the sake of it.

## Current general state

## Screenshots
This is very much a work in progress, but seeing how things are is nice, so I'll put some screenshots from times to times.
